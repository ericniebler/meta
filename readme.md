# Meta: A tiny metaprogramming library

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ericniebler/meta.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ericniebler/meta)

*Meta* is a tiny and header-only C++11 metaprogramming library released under the
Boost Software License. To compile with meta you just have to:

```.cpp
#include <meta/meta.hpp>
```

For a quick start see Eric Niebler's blog post:
[A tiny metaprogramming library](http://ericniebler.com/2014/11/13/tiny-metaprogramming-library/). (Note: the names in Meta are different from those describe in the blog post, but the overall design remains the same.)

To generate the up-to-date tutorial and documentation run `make doc` in the
build directory (requires Doxygen, LaTeX, dvips, ghostscript).
